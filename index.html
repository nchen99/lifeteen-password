                    2. What day of the week is lifeteen on? Now take the third letter of that day. <br> <br>
                    3. Recently Tristan did an IG story takeover on the St. Paul’s life teen instagram! What time did he start his IG takeover? Now take the second number from the time <br> <br>
                    4. There are many announcements on the Parish Bulletin. For example, there is an online event that will be happening on Sept. 19! What is the name of this event? Now take the first letter of this event. <br> <br>
                    5. On Elena’s IG takeover she mentioned that she was a _____? (hint: it’s on the first story of her takeover!) What is the first letter of this word? <br> <br>
                    6. Double points! This letter appears two times in the final password. How old will St. Pauls Life Teen be in 23 years? Now what’s the Roman Numeral for this letter? <br> <br>
                    7. Congrats you’ve made it! Now all these letters will make a word, with some of the words being replaced by numbers, because you want secure passwords to your instagram ;). What is this word / password? <br> <br>
